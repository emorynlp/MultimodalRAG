Body Deformation Analysis
The following table shows the deformation measurements
at various vehicle sections during a crash test. The red line
represents the evaluation model, while the blue line represents the baseline model (P2).Measurements are shown in
centimeters and are categorized into ’GOOD’, ’ACCEPTABLE’, ’MARGINAL’, and ’POOR’ ratings.
...
Body Deformation Table
{Table}
The table provides a detailed breakdown of deformation
measurements for each section of the vehicle body.
The baseline model (P2) achieved an overall rating of ’G’
(Good), while the evaluation model received an overall
rating of ’A’ (Acceptable). ...",Were there cases where the body rating significantly decreased?,"{1: '—\nRegion: USA\nTest Name: 64kph Small Overlap 25% (RH)\nStage: Proto\nPurpose: Development of GTC Proto Performance.\n—\nBody Deformation Analysis\nThe following table shows the deformation measurements\nat various vehicle sections during a crash test.

seat over time. The maximum acceleration reaches approximately 40G at 0.05 seconds, followed by a sharp
decrease and subsequent fluctuations. ...
