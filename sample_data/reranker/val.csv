This table illustrates the distribution of kinematic energy across various vehicle models. 
Initial Kinetic refers to the initial kinetic energy, absorbed Energy represents the proportion of energy absorbed by the Front and A/PLR, and Final Kinetic indicates the final energy distribution on the X-axis and Y-axis. 
For the HDC 1 and GDC 2 models, …
