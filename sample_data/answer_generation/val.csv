"What are the key features of Reel Spot welding technology, and how does it form welding nuggets?",Reel Spot welding technology forms rectangular welding nuggets using copper tape. It eliminates the tip dressing process by applying continuous copper tape and develops one-sided linear welding electrodes.
Has there been an example where improving the vehicle structure prevented the fracture of components?,"Yes, there have been cases where improving the vehicle structure prevented the fracture of components. First, in the ’HDC EV’ project, the design of the front bumper beam (FRT B/Beam) was changed to prevent fracture. In the T-CAR model, fracture occurred in the FRT B/Beam, but in the Proto model, it was modified to a closed cross-section shape, preventing fracture. Additionally, in the ’HGC’ project, body structure improvements were made to reduce the risk of deformation and fracture of several components. For example, reinforcing the upper part of the A-pillar and the COWL BAR improved bending deformation. Adding UPR HINGE B/H beads and other deformation-guiding methods reduced opening misalignment. Finally, in the ’QYZ’ project, a plan was proposed to improve the tendency of fracture by adding reinforcements to the S/MBR RR lower end. All of these improvements aim to optimize the body structure and prevent component fracture during collisions."
